<h2>Self-Serve Library</h2>
<p>This pilot service is available to registered borrowers of our Braille and Talking Book Library, who may request books from our lending collection to be delivered as downloadable files in the DAISY format.</p> 

<p>All you need to do to use this service is select your chosen item and follow the instructions. There will be some delay between sending your request and receiving the DAISY digital book. This is particularly the case if the item you ask for is in cassette format, because it needs to be reformatted. Some of the cassette books in our collection are old and the quality of the recorded product could be compromised. We shall supply the DAISY book with an evaluation form; we urge you to complete and return this form because your feedback is invaluable.</p> 

<p>If you are not a registered member of our library and would like to borrow a cassette audio book from our lending collection, it may be available on inter-library loan. Please place a request at your local public library.</p>
